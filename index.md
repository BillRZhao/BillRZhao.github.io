## Bio


Hello! I am an incoming PhD in Economics student in Georgetown University. In my spare time, I like to play the piano, go hiking, and read interesting books. My favorite composers are Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert.

My current interest lies in Econometrics and Microeconomics Theory. I draw inspiration from both the literature and the empirical projects I have done. In the following sections you can see some of my past projects. I am also actively improving my math knowledge to be better prepared for my future research.

I believe in the value of sharing, thus I make all of my notes public, with appropriate citations of the lectures of my professors.

You can find my [CV](https:\\BillRZhao.github.io/notes/CV-Runzhe%20Zhao.pdf) here.
