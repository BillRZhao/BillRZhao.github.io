Hello! I am a second year Master's student in Economics at Duke University. In my spare time, I like to play the piano, go hiking, and read interesting books. I am also actively improving my math knowledge to be better prepared for my future research.

My current interest lies in Econometrics and Microeconomics Theory. I draw inspiration from both the literature and the empirical projects I have done. In the following sections you can some of my past projects.

I believe in the value of sharing, thus I make all of my notes public, with appropriate citations of the lectures of my professors.
